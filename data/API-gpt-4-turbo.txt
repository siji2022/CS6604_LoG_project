### Explanation:
- **Single Point Shifts**: Identified where a single data point significantly deviates from the surrounding data points in any of the three columns.
- **Persistent Level Shifts**: Detected where there is a consistent change in the data level that deviates from the normal range over a period.
- **Multiple Points Oscillate**: Identified where multiple consecutive data points fluctuate significantly, indicating potential anomalies.

Each row in the output CSV indicates a timestamp and nodeid where at least one of the three monitored variables (temperature, humidity, voltage) was found to be anomalous. The columns `temperature_anomaly`, `humidity_anomaly`, and `voltage_anomaly` are marked with a '1' if an anomaly was detected and '0' otherwise. Only entries with at least one anomaly are included, as per the instructions.
