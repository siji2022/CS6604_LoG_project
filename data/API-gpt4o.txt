To identify anomalies in the dataset, I will follow these steps:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the data and understand the structure. The data consists of columns: "timestamp", "nodeid", "temperature", "humidity", and "voltage".
   - Check for any missing values or inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Anomaly Detection Criteria**:
   - **Single Point Shift**: Identify any single data point that significantly deviates from the rest of the data points in the same column.
   - **Multiple Points Oscillation**: Look for sequences of data points that oscillate significantly.
   - **Persistent Level Shift**: Detect any sustained shift in the level of data points over a period.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Calculate statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range for each column to establish a baseline for normal behavior.
   - Use these statistics to set thresholds for detecting anomalies.

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - For each column, identify anomalies based on the defined criteria.
   - Mark anomalies with a '1' and normal data points with a '0'.

5. **Result Compilation**:
   - Compile the results in the specified CSV format, including only the rows where at least one column has an anomaly.

Here are the results in CSV format:

This CSV format includes only the rows where at least one of the columns ("temperature", "humidity", "voltage") has been marked as an anomaly.
