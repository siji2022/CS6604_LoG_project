**Explanation:**
- The anomalies were detected based on significant deviations from typical values observed in the dataset.
- For temperature and humidity, anomalies were considered when values were significantly higher or lower than the average trends observed across different nodes and timestamps.
- For voltage, anomalies were flagged when values deviated from the expected range of operational voltages for typical devices (assuming a hypothetical normal range).
- The CSV format lists each anomaly with a timestamp, node ID, and flags for anomalies in temperature, humidity, and voltage respectively. A '1' indicates an anomaly was detected, while a '0' indicates normal behavior.

This analysis helps in identifying specific instances and nodes where unusual readings may indicate potential issues or errors in data collection, requiring further investigation or corrective measures.
