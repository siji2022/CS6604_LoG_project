To analyze the provided dataset for anomalies in the columns "temperature", "humidity", and "voltage", I will follow a systematic approach based on the definitions of anomalies provided.

### Step 1: Data Preparation
First, I will parse the JSON data into a structured format that allows for easier analysis. The dataset consists of multiple readings across different timestamps and node IDs.

### Step 2: Identify Anomaly Types
I will look for the following types of anomalies:

1. **Single Point Shifts**: A single reading that is significantly different from the others in its immediate vicinity.
2. **Multiple Points Oscillation**: A series of readings that fluctuate significantly over a short period.
3. **Persistent Level Shift**: A consistent change in readings over a period of time.

### Step 3: Analyze Each Column
I will analyze each of the three columns separately for anomalies.

#### Temperature Analysis
- **Single Point Shifts**: I will check for any temperature readings that are significantly higher or lower than the surrounding values. For example, a reading of 122.15 is an obvious outlier compared to typical temperature values.
- **Multiple Points Oscillation**: I will look for sequences of temperature readings that show significant fluctuations.
- **Persistent Level Shift**: I will check for any sustained increase or decrease in temperature readings over time.

#### Humidity Analysis
- Similar to temperature, I will check for single point shifts, oscillations, and persistent shifts in humidity readings.

#### Voltage Analysis
- I will perform the same checks for voltage readings, looking for outliers, oscillations, and persistent shifts.

### Step 4: Compile Anomalies
After identifying the anomalies in each column, I will compile the results into the specified CSV format. Each row will include the timestamp, node ID, and indicators for whether each column has an anomaly (1 for anomaly, 0 for normal).

### Step 5: Results
Based on the analysis, here are the identified anomalies:

```csv
timestamp,nodeid,temperature_anomaly,humidity_anomaly,voltage_anomaly
1516,17,1,0,0
1518,17,1,0,0
1547,16,1,0,0
1550,17,1,0,0
1552,17,1,0,0
1553,17,1,0,0
1554,17,1,0,0
1555,16,1,0,0
```

### Summary of Findings
- **Single Point Shifts**: The readings of 122.15 in temperature are significant outliers and have been flagged as anomalies.
- **No significant oscillations** were found in the humidity and voltage readings.
- **No persistent level shifts** were detected in any of the columns.

This analysis indicates that the primary anomalies are related to the temperature readings, specifically the extreme values that deviate from the expected range. The other two columns did not show significant anomalies based on the criteria provided.
